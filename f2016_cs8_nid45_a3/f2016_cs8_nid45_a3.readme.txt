So I started this project the same as I did the last one. I started by drawing up an outline showing what I wanted to get out of the program and what the most efficient way to get there was. So the first thing I had to do was create the functions that could gather the data I needed. First I realized that I could re-use my PrintKv function from the last assignment so I could sort through the information based on the data type and then organize it. Next I had to create a function that would keep track of the major information. I once again could use part of my function from the previous assignment where I could count the lines and total distance run. Then I had to add in a functionality that sorted the participants by name and counted how many times they showed up throughout the files. I was able to use a for loop to count how many times the participants names showed up. Next I had to take the information I had just gathered and save it in dictionaries and create the output file. Then I started on the main function. Then I opened the files that I needed, made them comprehendible for the program, and printed the final needed data.
