I started doing this assingment by writing out an outline on a seperate piece of paper where i put together the
steps that I wanted to take to get the result I wanted. I wrote it out as a list like this

Define the functions I need
Start with PrintKV function where I can print and format the values based on the given data type
To do this I needed to check what data type the input was

Then I decided to define the processfile where the function would evaluate the lines in the given file. The function
has to track the amount of lines and the total distance. Then I had to set a loop that would go through the file
lines and take out the new line at the end of each value. Then I had to take out the commas seperating the values.
From there we could count the lines as they were evaluated in 1 line increments.

When I started on the main function I could create a loop where it would aske for a file to evaluate as many times
as needed until the user inputted the word "quit", where it would stop and diaplay the totals of the docements
added up. Then the only remaining issue was to call the main function at the end so it would be used.
